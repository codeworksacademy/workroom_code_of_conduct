# CodeWorks Workroom Code of Conduct

Welcome back, Alumni! To maintain a productive learning environment for everyone, please review and abide by the following:

## Respectful Behavior

- Treat all individuals with respect and courtesy.
- Be mindful of your noise level to maintain a productive learning atmosphere.
- Avoid offensive language or behavior that may make others uncomfortable.
- Keep the door to this workroom shut during lecture times.
- Do not add or remove furniture from these rooms (excluding extra chairs as needed).
- Keep the workroom tidy and organized.
- Refrain from disposing of food waste in the workroom trash.

## Shared Resources

- You are welcome to use any resources you had as a student (books, monitors, power strips, etc.).
- Priority access to these resources is given to currently enrolled students, and you may be asked to give up the resource.
- Assistance from Instruction staff is available based on the current needs of students.
- If a student needs assistance while you are being helped by staff, please excuse yourself.
- Be considerate of others when using shared amenities such as the Arcade or Ping Pong. These are tools for current students to destress, not for your leisure.
- Return any resources before you leave for the day.

- Avoid spoiling checkpoints.
- Refrain from providing solutions to their code, even if they ask.
- Encourage students.
- Share your student experience.
- Do Socialize.

## Visitor Policy

- Visitors do not have access to shared resources.
- Visitors may not stay longer than 1 hour.
- Visitors must not disrupt the work or concentration of others in the office room.
